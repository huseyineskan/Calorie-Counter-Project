# Calorie Counter Project
Learn Form Validation by Building a Calorie Counter

## Description

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

In this practice project, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the `addEventListener()` method, and more.

## Features
- A person can enter her/his daily calorie target.
- He/She can add how many calories he consumes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, and enter how many calories he burns through exercises.
- As a result, it can display whether I have a calorie deficit or a calorie surplus.
